My first Odin Project project... 
Testing...

I wrote index.html as the structure for a clone of the Google hompage. 
Elements were broken down by location on the page and use.

-- BREAKDOWN OF CLASS NAMES USED --

"tnav" = top navigation bar
"tleft" and "tright" = the links in tnav that are located to either the left or the right of the page

"bnav" = bottom naviagation bar
"bleft" and "bright" = same naming convention

"logo", "sbar" and "but" were used for the Google logo, Search Bar and Buttons, respectively.

"bleft" and "bright" were used for the "Search Google" and the "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons.
